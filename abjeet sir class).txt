7 Layer of OSI Model
*Application layer
 provide certain type of service 
*Presentation Layer
 process the data(encrypet,decryped,coding,compressing)
*Session layer
 it provide the door for the data to send other nodes
*transport layer
 data delivery/chopping the data into small pices or segiment /tcp,udp
*network layer
 it decide the path of the data destanition(router is use here) 
*data link layer
 decate error/hub to hub sending/framing(process of covering packet with ip address of the destanitation)(switch)
*physical layer
 it coverte data in current and voltage(wire)
